Description: 
	This directory contains two subdirectories, calibration (contains scripts 
	used to generate calibration figures and tables) and zone_budget (contains
	inputs for the ZoneBudget program, used to process the MODFLOW cell-by-cell 
	output file, along with the ZoneBudget executable file). 
		
		To run the ZoneBudget program that processes the MODFLOW cell-by-cell output file (rr_tr.cbc):
			1) Go to: rr_model_archive\ancillary\zone_budget
			2) For zones set to subbasins: double-click on zb_subbasins_[model_name].bat
			3) For zones set to the entire Russian River watershed: double-click on zb_watershed_[model_name].bat
			4) Results will be sent to the modflow output folder for that model (i.e. the same folder that contains the rr_tr.cbc file)
		
		To run the calibration scripts that evaluate the calibration of the baseline model (hist_baseline), follow these steps:
			1) Go to: rr_model_archive\ancillary\calibration\scripts
			2) Open up plot_all_gsflow.py in a Python Integrated Development Environment (we used PyCharm).
			3) Make sure the correct option is chosen for the variable "mf_name_file_type", depending on whether 
			   you ran the model with all possible outputs or fewer outputs.
			4) Run plot_all_gsflow.py.  Plots and tables evaluating streamflow, groundwater heads, lake stages and volumes, 
			   and well pumping reduction will be sent to rr_model_archive\ancillary\calibration\results.  They will be 
			   organized into sub-directories as described in the directory structure below.
			5) Open up calculate_ag_water_use.py in a Python Integrated Development Environment.  In the 
			   "set model-simulated values" section, insert the simulated agricultural water use by wells, 
			   diversions, ponds, and total.  The simulated agricultural water use can be found in the volumetric 
			   agricultural budget listed at the last time step in the rr_tr.list file generated by the simulation.  
			   Run calculate_ag_water_use.py.  The water use in units of meters/yr will be printed to the screen 
			   and can be compared to literature values.
