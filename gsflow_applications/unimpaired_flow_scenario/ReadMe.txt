Folder for unimpaired flow scenario: 
- Russian_River/: Russian River unimpaired-flow model and extracted budget files
- SRP/: Santa Rosa Plain unimpaired-flow model and extracted budget files
- plots/: a folder for graphs of model budgets to compare model outputs.

The unimpaired-flow models are intended to be a scenario in which all anthropogenic 
impacts on the hydrologic system are removed. This includes extraction from wells
and stream and lake diversions. Non of the other boundary conditions or climate
input data are modified.

Scripts for processing model budgets and plotting results are included.
